        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>If we are serious about reducing recidivism - all possible avenues to enable people to find a stake in society must be explored.</p>

        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on state-of-the-art dental reconstruction that is normally prohibitively expensive for most, yet would seem potentially to offer ‘best-practice’ for those people with the poorest dental health.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>People who have made tremendous effort to address their drug problems already face numerous barriers in entering the workplace. Those who have lost all or nearly all of their teeth have a form of facial disfigurement.</p>

        <h2>What’s Happened So Far?</h2>
        <p>Brian was selected as the first person to go through the Teeth Project in 2011. With all his teeth having been extracted whilst in prison in 1999, he had lived with pain and low self-esteem for the last twelve years due to awful and badly fitting dentures. He now has a new set of highly functional and natural looking fixed teeth.</p>
        <p>Brian is due to complete his psychology degree in New York this year and plans a career in addiction treatment and human rights.

      <div class="span6">
        <h2>Project Ambition</h2>
        <p>With the support of top clinicians in Los Angeles and the generosity of two companies that make implants and natural looking fixed teeth, work is currently taking place to make this remarkable process more widely available. The doctors and companies involved are prepared to provide their services for free.  However, nursing, theatre fees and other costs still need to be found.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">History</h2>
      <p>The Teeth Project was born out of my own personal experience.  Through years of drug use, living in remote parts of the world, altercations and periods of incarceration – I lost almost all my teeth.  For a while I managed to get by with temporary plastic bridges hanging on to the few remaining rotten stumps.</p>
      <p>Now living a life that brought me into daily contact with doctors, lawyers and other professionals – my tenuous teeth situation exacerbated my feelings of inadequacy. I had little education; no qualifications and my CV had twenty years of unexplainable gaps.  I was now running a national organisation - Release - that demanded public appearances and my teeth were running out.
      </p>
      <p>I was lucky – with much support - I commenced a complete dental reconstruction in 2005 - bone grafts, 17 implants and a strong set of gleaming new teeth.</p>
      <p>It is fair to say that this procedure completely changed my life.</p>
      <p>During this process it became clear to me that there were thousands like me who with some help in getting new teeth could have the same life changing experience.</p>
      <p>It was from this realisation that the idea for the Teeth Project was born.</p>
