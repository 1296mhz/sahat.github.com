        <h2 class="featurette-heading">History</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Teeth Project was born out of my own personal experience.  Through years of drug use, living in remote parts of the world, altercations and periods of incarceration – I lost almost all my teeth.  For a while I managed to get by with temporary plastic bridges hanging on to the few remaining rotten stumps.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          Now living a life that brought me into daily contact with doctors, lawyers and other professionals – my tenuous teeth situation exacerbated my feelings of inadequacy. I had little education; no qualifications and my CV had twenty years of unexplainable gaps.  I was now running a national organisation - Release - that demanded public
          appearances and my teeth were running out.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">I was lucky – with much support - I commenced a complete dental reconstruction in 2005 - bone grafts, 17 implants and a strong set of gleaming new teeth.</p>
        <p class="lead">It is fair to say that this procedure completely changed my life.</p>

        <p class="lead">During this process it became clear to me that there were thousands like me who with some help in getting new teeth
          could have the same life changing experience.</p>
        <p class="lead">It was from this realisation that the idea for the Teeth Project was born.</p>
