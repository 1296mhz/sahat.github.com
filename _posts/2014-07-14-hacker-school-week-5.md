I have spent a good chunk of the week working on the [ngAuth](https://github.com/sahat/ngAuth)
module for AngularJS. At the moment it only works with token-based authentication
using username and password. This week I will work on adding the social sign-in
integration with Facebook, Google and Twitter. And as promised, I will include
examples for various programming languages to make your back-end integration seamless.

Jekyll Blog Editor that I have been working on is currently on-hold until the
next version release of [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).
Until they bundle *Google Chrome 37* with [DirectWrite](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd368038(v=vs.85).aspx)
support, working on this project in a Windows 8.1 environment with a Hi-DPI
display is going to be a huge pain. This is similar to having a Macbook Pro with 
Retina Display when most apps are still designed for non-retina displays.

Every Thursday we have brief, internal persentations at Hacker School.This past
Thursday, I gave a short 5-minute presentation on token-based authentication
and how it compared with traditional cookie-based authentication. Here are the
[slides](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=7A3806B5AA2E823A!4647&authkey=!AJ1-4N5Frk4Ma5I&ithint=file%2c.pptx).

In other news, not related to Hacker School, I have become a big fan of
Japanese visual novels. Up until about a week ago I didn't know about their
existence. It's no secret, I love watching anime, and I know there is usually a 
manga for each anime, but I didn't know about visual novels.
I am currently on the *Chapter 4* of [Ch√§oS;HEAd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos;Head) 
and I know I should be writing code instead right now, but this visual novel is the only thing
that is currently on my mind.
