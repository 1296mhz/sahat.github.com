CloudBucket is the online cloud storage system with a semantic search capability.
Whenever you upload a file to CloudBucket, it is tagged automatically based on its file contents.
For instance, a music file will receive a covert art, lyrics, artist information, similar artists
and last.fm tags that describe that particular song. You can then, for example, search for a keyword
that is contained in the lyrics of that song and it will return this file in the search results.
Typical search systems return results that match a keyword in the filename only,
not based on its file contents.

Technology Stack: **Node.js, Python, MongoDB, AWS, jQuery, Grunt.js, Bower, Google OAuth 2.0,
Google Books API, SkyBiometry API, Last.fm API, Musixmatch API**
