I have moved to California exactly one year ago. Six months in the SF Bay Area and six months in Los Angeles. It would not be an exaggeration to say it has been one of the best and most memorable times of my life.

My cross-country road trip starts tomorrow â€” October 1, 2015.

To be honest, I have never driven in a car for longer than 540 miles, that is why I am both excited and a little uncertain how this trip will turn out.

As far as charging goes, I have lost count of how many Tesla Supercharger stations there are currently available in the U.S. alone. It will not be an issue at all. All these charging stations are free to use. The only "negative" about it is that you have to sit and wait for the car to charge. Personally, I do not find it too bad as it gives me a time to relax, take a quick nap, check e-mail, [push code to GitHub](https://github.com/sahat).

That reminds me, maybe I should post a blog about all my coding adventures and how I almost ran out of the battery charge in my car because I had to go back to town to get the LTE connection service on my iPhone, so that I could push a few GitHub commits, then drive back all the way up to the mountain where there is no cell reception.

Not kidding, I will code anywhere and everywhere if my laptop is with me.

Anyhow, there is a long day ahead of me tomorrow so I need to get some rest. I will continue to blog about this road trip daily, so stay tuned!
