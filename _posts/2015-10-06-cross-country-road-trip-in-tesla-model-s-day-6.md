I woke up at 8:30am and left around 9:00am. Before leaving the town, I stopped by *The Grind* cafe in New Philadelphia for a Fall-seasoned drink called *Harvest Latte*, and then left with about 88 miles left in the battery. Since there weren't any superchargers close by, I had to be conservative about the energy usage until I got to my next destination.

Most of the drive through Ohio has been in a one-lane highway at 55mph or 65mph. When passing small towns, I had to reduce speed to as low as 25mph. However, it was a scenic drive, so I did not mind driving slow at all.

The first stop was in *Triadelphia, West Virginia*. It is located on the border of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. I did not stay there for too long since it didn't have much nearby other than a hotel.

Next stop was *Somerset, Pennsylvania*. I had to pay toll twice in this state just to pass through the highway and exit in Somerset to charge my car. Tolls aren't that expensive, it is just annoying that I have to stop, plus I don't carry much cash on me. I was actually short 80 cents and the lady had to take my driver's license and gave me a receipt so I could pay it online (+$2 convenience fee).

If you are wondering what are those white stickers on the side of my car — that's HOV lane stickers that allow me to drive in the "carpool" lane in California. I will have to take them off soon because I will not be needing them in NY/NJ.

Once I had enough charge to reach my next destination, I left for *Hagerstown, Maryland*. Oh Maryland, where do I even start... Drivers, especially truck drivers need to slow the F down. Truck drivers should not be driving 75 mph in a 55mph zone on a 2-lane highway. Some drivers were even going 25 miles over the speed limit. If everyone is speeding so much, cops either need to enforce it better or speed limit should be raised from 55mph to 65mph.

About an hour away from *Baltimore*, there was a standstill traffic jam for almost 30 minutes. There was a big accident where one of the car was flipped over on the side of the road.

*Hagerstown, Maryland* is a nice little town. The superchargers were located behind the Mall parking lot. I went it to get some food and left without any delay. I did not mind staying longer when I was passing through Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Missouri, but being so close to home I just wanted to get home as soon as possible. And once you have seen one city in the Northeast, you have seen them all. Same craziness, but on a different scale.

It was past 6:00pm and I was driving on the outskirts of *Baltimore*. Traffic was bad, but fortunately not as bad as Los Angeles at this time.

I stopped in Delaware next. It was already dark outside. Even though there were people around, and lots of cars parked outside the Delaware Welcome Center, it felt a little eery there. Inside, while I was getting a coffee, I saw a few black people being roudy and obnoxious. Yep, welcome to the East Coast.

The only stop I had to do in New Jersey was in *Edison*, which is about 30 minutes from where I live. There were 2 other Teslas charging, which is the most I have seen since I left LA.

Once I had enough battery charge, my final destination was *Home*. It is hard to believe, but I actually made it home safe and sound, across the entire country passing California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey.

I probably won't drive the car to New York until I get my EZPass to pay for tunnel and bridge tolls, but even then, I will try to avoid the city as much as possible, and just take public transit instead. Well, at least for now until I figure out if Yahoo! in New York has tolls & parking reimbursements. Otherwise it would be too expensive to drive a car to New York on a daily basis, when instead I could jus take a bus for fraction of a cost.

Fortunately, I did not run into any deer in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but if you are curious this is what happens when a Tesla hits a deer.

*Hint: Not much. Tesla is almost like a battering ram, weighing at 4,647—4,830 lbs.*
