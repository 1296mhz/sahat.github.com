JavaScript - The programming language of the future?
=================

Github is a homeplace to more than 4 million git repositories. Among all those repositories, JavaScript holds the first place at 20% of total repositories, followed by Ruby and Python at 15% and 9% respectively. This evidence sugests that JavaScript has a very active community.

JavaScript is not a toy scriping language anymore. It has matured over the years into a serious object-oriented programming language. There are many MVC/MVVM frameworks (e.g. Backbone.js, Spine.js, Knockout.js, JavascriptMvc, AngularJS) that help you create full blown asynchronous client-side applications inside the browser. Spotify, Pandora, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and many other notable web applications are now heavily using JavaScript frameworks for their front-end development. JavaScript is a very powerful language, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

There's no denying that JavaScript is an extremely popular language on the client-side. The year 2009 had marked a new milestone for the language - JavaScript on the server. Ryan Dahl, has developed the node.js platform - an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that is designed for data-intensive real-time web applications. JavaScript was a natural choice for Node.js due to the non-blocking i/o from the ground up. That's not the case with Python, Java, C++ or Ruby. Having JavaScript on the server was a big deal (and still is) to many developers because essentially you could use the same programming language, the same concepts, and the same libraries, both on the client and on the server. [NPM](http://npmjs.org/) hosts more than 7,000 node.js packages written in JavaScript. That's a pretty large number of packages given such a young age of node.js

One of the biggest steps forward for JavaScript is the Microsoft's announcement of using JavaScript/HTML/CSS stack to develop Metro style applications in Windows 8. Of course a desktop development will not exactly be the same as a web development despite using the same programming language, but the fact that there will be one common language I think is a big deal.

JavaScript is already the most ubiquitous language in the world, and with native integration into Windows 8, as well as the latest buzz surrounding HTML5, it is only inevitable until JavaScript becomes the most dominant programming language, taking over the Java throne. 

If you are a beginner or an aspiring programmer who is looking to learn a new programming language, you absolutelly cannot go wrong with JavaScript.
[Code Academy](http://codeacademy.com/) has fantastic tutorials for you to get started in developing JavaScript applications. After you finish with that, I highly recommend you pick up *JavaScript: The Good Parts* and *JavaScript Patterns* at Barnes & Noble or Amazon.
