I am really glad that I have finally released the [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer)
project. At the moment of writing it is currently in the *Top 5* on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).
I worked on that project non-stop for nearly 2 weeks at the Hacker School,
leaving almost no time for anything else in my life. That's why today
will be my day off. Perhaps a good time to read the [If I Stay](http://www.amazon.com/If-I-Stay-Gayle-Forman/dp/014241543X)
book before the movie comes out this Friday.

If you signed up for the [Angular.js NYC August Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-NYC/events/198975082/)
I am looking forward to meeting everyone tomorrow. This is going to be my
best presentation ever as I have put a lot of time and effort in making
the slides and refining the project for this talk.

Cheers,

Sahat
