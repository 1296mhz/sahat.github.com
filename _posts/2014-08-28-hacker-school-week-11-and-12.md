Today is my last day at Hacker School. It's hard to believe how fast the
Summer went by. I am not going to lie, the last 3 months at Hacker School have
been a total blast. I never had an opportunity
before where I could write code and focus exclusively on programming for three
months without any responsibilities, deadlines or distractions. While I wish I
could stay at Hacker School for a little bit longer, I am super excited
about my relocation to the beautiful California to be a part of **Yahoo! Inc**.

I would also like to give shout-outs to *Brian Ruslim* for helping me out with
whenever I was stuck with JavaScript, and for all those *long* lunch walks to *Prosperity Dumplings*
in Chinatown where you can buy 10 delicious pork dumplings for $2.75,
*Alice Chen* for all your great contributins to [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer),
*Marcus Malka* for your awesome code review feedback, and to many others: *Jorge Izquierdo*, *Carlos SÃ¡nchez Serrano*,
*Costa Michailidis*, *Nicholas Sweeting*, *Dana Sniezko*. Additionally, I would
like to thank all the facilitators for making Hacker School so awesome.

So, now that Hacker School is over, what's next? I am going to start packing bags
as I am moving to the Bay Area in 2 days. As for my GitHub projects, I am going
to continue working on my open-source projects [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)
and [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) at Yahoo. The next
big thing that I plan to release later this year will be the free and open-source
cross-platform Markdown editor with Jekyll blog integration, using *React* and
*atom-shell* or *node-webkit*. It was my first project at Hacker School, but
I had to put it on hold in order to create [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer)
in 2-3 weeks.

**Coming Soon:** The next blog post will be about the architecture behind the Satellizer. We'll
dive deep into the library to see how it works - on the server and the client.
