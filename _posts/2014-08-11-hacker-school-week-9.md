excerpt: A blog post about my NYC Hacker School experience -- Week 9.

Last week I have been working intensely on the AngularJS authentication module.
I was debating on what to name it; since **ngAuth**, **angular-auth** and all
related terms are already taken on *Bower* and *NPM* registries I decided to
name it [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) - after Satellizer
L. Bridget.

I have learned a lot about testing last week. For example, I had no idea how
easy it was to generate these coverage reports:

Having a coverage report gave me enough motivation to write unit tests that I 
would otherwise would be too lazy to write. But to be frank I am not too fond
of unit testing. I would rather spend **X** number of hours fixing actual bugs 
and improving the app rather spend **X** number of hours writing tests to
confirm what I already know by writing tests. Perhaps once I get comfortable
with testing I won't feel like that, but right now writing unit tests is a huge
time sink for me.

I am going to publish an in-depth blog post later this week or at the beginning
of next week on how to do OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 authentication with AngularJS.
