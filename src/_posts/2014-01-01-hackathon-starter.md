[Demo](http://seniorproject.herokuapp.com/) - [Source Code](https://github.com/sahat/audiostreamer/)

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
Anyone who knows a little bit of JavaScript should be able to get started without too much pain.
I tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific.

**Primary features**:
- Local authentication using Email and Password
- OAuth2 sign in via Twitter, Facebook, Google or GitHub
- Model-View-Controller separation
- Bootstrap 3 + Flat UI theme
- Contact Form
- Account Management
- 9 API Examples

Technology Stack: **Node.js, MongoDB**
