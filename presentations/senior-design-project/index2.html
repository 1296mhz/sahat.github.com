      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Today's digital economy relies on the collection of personal data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Medical history, searches, browsing history information is collected and shared with advertisers, researchers and government.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Developing effective privacy protection is a crucial for security and privacy research as the amount and variety of data collected increase exponentially.</p>

        <h2>What is PII?</h2>
        <p>
        According to California Senate Bill 1386:
        <ul>
          <li>Social security number</li>
          <li>Driver's license number</li>
          <li>Financial accounts</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong>E-mail address and telephone numbers are not part of Personally Identifiable Information.</strong>
        </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <p>These laws were enacted in response to security breaches and identity theft.</p>
         <br>
        <p>They focus on types of data that could be used for authenticating individual, as opposed to those that <strong>violate privacy</strong> by revealing sensitive information about the person.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>PII also appears in the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 which regulates the collection of personal information by government agencies.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>There is no federal law that regulates private entities.</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Generic privacy laws in other counties include <em>Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> and <em>Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament</em> (Data Protection Directive).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p><em>Data Protection Directive</em> defines personal data as: <strong>"any information relating to natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity".</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</em> defines individually identifiable health information as information that:
        <ol>
          <li>Identifies the individual.</li>
          <li>There is a reasonable basis to believe that information can be used to identify the individual.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      </section>

    </section>

      <section>
        <h2>PII and Privacy Protection</h2>
        <p>
          Many companies that collect personal information assure you that their information will be released in "non-personally identifiable form", <em>i.e. without name and contact information or some other fixed-set of attributes.</em>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The "identifying" and "non-identifying" information is meaningless in today's world with exponentially increasing amount and variety of publicly available information about individual.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Existing privacy technologies such as <strong>k-anonimity</strong> rely on the fallacious distinction between "identifying" and "non-identifying" information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To apply <strong>k-anonimity</strong>, the set of quasi-identifier attributes such as zip code, birth date, gender, must be fixed in advance and assumed to be the same for all users. The rest of the attributes are assumed to be "non-identifying".</p>
        <br>
        <p>De-identification involves in modifying these quasi-identifiers to satisfy syntactic properties, such as "every combination of quasi-identifier values must occur at least k times."</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section>
        <h2>Re-identification without PII</h2>
        <p>
          Any information that distinguishes one person from another can be used for re-identifying anonymous data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AOL Fiasco, where the content of search queries was used to re-identify the user.</li>
          <li>Re-identification using movie viewing histories (or any behavioral or transactional profile) and local structure of social networks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>There is a wide spectrum of human characteristics that enable re-identification:
        <ul>
          <li>consumption preferences</li>
          <li>commercial transactions</li>
          <li>web browsing</li>
          <li>search histories</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>They are reasonably stable across time and contexts.</em></p>
        <p><em>Corresponding data attributes are sufficiently numerous and fine-grained so that no two people are alike.</em></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Moral of the story:</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>"Personally identifiable" information and "quasi-identifier" have no technical meaning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While it is true that some attributes like <em>social security number</em> can uniquely identify an individual on their own, <em><strong>any attribute can be identifying in combination with others.</strong></em></p>
        <br>
        <p>In other words, any sufficiently large subset of information uniquely identifies the individual.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          Implementing re-identification algorithms based on behavioral attributes are more computationally expensive and much more difficult to implement than re-identification based on quasi-identifiers.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Lessons for Privacy Practitioners</h2>
        <p>The entire privacy protection paradigm based on <strong>"de-identifying data"</strong> is flawed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          De-identification provides only a weak form of privacy. It keeps honest people honest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Increasing economic incentives for potential attackers and a large amount of publicly available information from social networks renders it obsolete.</p>

      </section>

    <section>
      <section>
        <h2>Beyond De-identification</h2>
        <p>Developing effective privacy protection technologies is a critical challenge for security and privacy research.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Step in the right direction: <strong>Differential Privacy</strong> - formally defines what it means for a computation to be privacy-preserving.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It doesn't offer a universal methodology for data release, but instead on a case-by-case basis.</p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Privacy-preserving computation on sensitive data must be accompanied by strong access control mechanisms as well as informed consent and contracts specifying acceptable uses of data.</p>
