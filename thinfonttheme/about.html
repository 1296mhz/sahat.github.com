            <h2><em>SOME OF MY FAVORITE THINGS</em></h2>
            <p>
                <em>Coding</em>. Programming is the only thing, other than gaming, that can keep me awake all-night without feeling exhausted.
                <em>Evanescence</em>. The one music band I probably couldn't live without.
                <em>Anime</em>. There are too many great animes to list, but Code Geass, Steins;Gate, Claymore are insanely amazing.
                <em>Macbook Pro Retina.</em> It is simply the best laptop computer that I have owned in recent years. One thing for sure, I will never be able to go back to non-HD screens anymore.
                <em>Photography</em>. I used to be very much into photography in 2010 and 2011, but now I usually take my Nikon D7100 with me only for special ocassions, such as weddings or conferences.
                <em>Kindle Paperwhite.</em> I love reading books. Especially Fiction. And even more so - Y.A. Fiction.
                <em>Olive Garden.</em> The unlimited salad is just too delicious. Did I mentioned unlimited salad?
                <em>Chilli's.</em> My second favorite chain restaurant after...
                <em>Applebee's.</em> The best appetizers!
                <em>Bose Quietcomfort 15.</em> My favorite headphones! Sound quality is really amazing, but the best part is noise-cancellation. Being in New York every day, noise cancelling headponones are a blessing. I only wish I bought them sooner. Worth every penny.
                <em>Running.</em> This is going to sound weird, but I fell in love with running after getting Nike Flyknit Lunar 1+ sneakers. No better motivation than a pair of well-made expensive sneakers! Finished Couch to 5K. Next up is to get under 20 minutes in a 5K.
                <em>Spring weather in New York.</em> The perfect 67 degrees partly cloudy weather.
